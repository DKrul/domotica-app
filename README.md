# Ionic 2 based custom domotica app

This is a custom homemade app to control our domotica at home. It's meant to make usage easier to control:
- fibaro / z-wave devices
- television and audio system
- ring.com doorbell

It uses the api's or other network based ways to communicate with the devices. It's free to use by everybody but it will need adaption to your situation and network. I just share this on Github to inspire others and to keep track of my own commit history.
